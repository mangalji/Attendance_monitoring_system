## Student Attendance & Fee Management System (Django)

A full-featured **Student Information System** built with **Django 6**, designed to help institutes manage **student profiles, attendance records, and fee payments** in one place.  
This project provides separate dashboards for **Managers** and **Students**, with role-based access, attendance analytics, fee tracking, and in-app notifications.

### 📥 Attendance Upload Format (Excel)

- Designed for **monthly attendance** import.
- The view:
  - Starts reading data from row 4 (`start_row = 4`)
  - Uses a specific column for roll number
  - Each cell for a day contains:
    - `IN_TIME OUT_TIME` (e.g. `10:00 18:30`)
- For each valid cell:
  - Computes `total_hours = out_time - in_time`
  - Saves/updates an `AttendanceRecord` for that student and date
- If a student roll number from the sheet does not exist in the system, that row is skipped gracefully.

You can adapt the Excel format or logic in `attendance/views.py` as needed.

---

### 🔔 Notifications & Fee Reminders

- Whenever fees are updated:
  - A **Notification** is created for the student:  
    “Your fees record has been updated. Total paid fees: ₹X”
- Managers can manually send a **fee reminder**:
  - Message like: “Reminder! Please pay your pending fees as soon as possible.”
- Students can see all these notifications in their notification page, with unread counts and read status.

---

### 🔐 Forgot Password Flow (Student)

- Accessible from the **“Forgot Password”** page (e.g., `/student/forgot_password/`).
- Student must enter:
  - Registered email
  - Registered phone
  - Roll number
  - New password + confirmation
- If details match, the system updates the password and the student can log in with the new credentials.

---

### ✅ Possible Improvements

- Add email or SMS integration for notifications and fee reminders.
- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for production.
- Add CSV export for fee and attendance reports.
- Enhance analytics: monthly attendance summaries, charts, etc.
- Add parent login to see student fees and attendance.
